for additional actions please raise a feature request at [github](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-behringer-x32)

If setting a fade duration, running another action for that value will cancel the first, and run the new one from the current level. If you wish to cancel a fade, run an 'Adjust fader level' with an offset of 0.
